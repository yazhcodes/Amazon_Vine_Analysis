# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview: 
   The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

   The purpose of this project is to analyze the Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program and determine if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members. For the purpose of this analysis, I have picked reviews from the Home Improvement products category.

## Results: 
* There were 266 Vine reviews and 38829 non-Vine reviews in the dataset.
* Out of 266 Vine reviews, 125 were 5-star reviews. 
* Out of 38829 non-Vine reviews, 18246 were 5-star reviews.
* The percentage of Vine reviews that were 5-stars was 46.99%.
* The percentage of non-Vine reviews that were 5-stars was also (_surprisingly_) 46.99% !

## Summary: 
   The results of this analysis clearly indicates that there is **absolutely no bias towards favorable reviews** by the members of the Amazon Vine Program. However further analysis could be conducted on other Product categories and also by broadening the '_favorable reviews_' filter from 5-star to '_4 and 5 stars_'.
